\section{Aims and Scope of the Publication}

\noindent The aim of the journal is to publish high quality
research papers connected to both production systems and
information engineering at the same time. Special emphasis is
given to articles on the theoretical models and methods, as well
as practical applications of discrete production processes
including new (or partially new) software tools. Using a new term
proposed in special literature in the nineties, the main profile
of this journal is Production Information Engineering.

\paragraph{Frequency of the journal} One volume per year is planned.

\section{Instructions for Authors}

\subsection{Manuscript Submission}

\noindent Manuscripts should be submitted to the Editor-in-Chief,
Prof. L\'aszl\'o \scshape{Kov\'acs}\upshape, or to the technical secretary Anita Ag\'ardi, who is responsible for preparing the manuscripts for printing:
\begin{itemize}
\item[--] L\'aszl\'o \scshape{Kov\'acs}\upshape :
kovacs@iit.uni-miskolc.hu 
\item[--] Anita
\scshape{Ag\'ardi}\upshape : agardianita@iit.uni-miskolc.hu
\end{itemize}
To speed up publication, email submission of \LaTeX\ manuscripts
is strongly recommended. In this case, please also supply the
corresponding PDF file of your paper that matches exactly the
source text.

\subsection{Conditions of Publication}

\noindent Submission of a manuscript implies that the paper has
not been published, nor is being considered for publication
elsewhere, and that a permission for publication, if needed, has
already been obtained from appropriate sources.

\noindent Please note that the editorial board holds the right to
change the format of the manuscript for compliance with the style
of the journal.

\subsection{Manuscript Preparation}

\subsubsection{Template Files}

\noindent Please, download the provided \textbf{PSAIE.zip} file to
obtain all the necessary template files for manuscript
preparation. This package includes:
\begin{list}{--}{\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}\setlength{\leftmargin}{15mm}}
\item \textbf{PSAIE.cls}: it contains all the default settings.
This file must be included into your \LaTeX\ file and should not
be changed under any circumstances. \item
\textbf{PSAIEsample.tex}: sample \LaTeX\ file -- this is to be
edited \item \textbf{PSAIEbib.bst}: bibliography style file to
prepare your bibliography by using Bib\TeX. Please, do not make
any changes to this file. \item \textbf{PSAIESampleBib.bib}:
sample Bib\TeX\ literature database file -- this is to be edited
\item \textbf{cimer-ff.eps}: picture file appearing in the first
page heading of the manuscript
\end{list}

\subsubsection{Graphic Files}

\noindent It is not recommended to use the built-in graphical
facilities of the editors. Please, prepare your figures with
special graphics tools and then include them in your manuscript.

\subsubsection{Note for Scientific Word and Scientific Workplace Users}

\noindent If you use Windows and Scientific Word or Scientific Workplace, please
make sure that you save your \LaTeX\ manuscript as the so-called
Portable \LaTeX. The final manuscript should not contain any
non-standard macros.


\section{Examples}

y_n(t,x)=
\begin{cases}
 f(t,x) & \text{for } (t,x) \in A \cr
f_n(t,x) & \text{for } (t,x) \not\in A.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent Some sample references: see
